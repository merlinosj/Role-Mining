 There are three algorithms that are implemented for role mining.
 Algorithm:1 Exact Computation
 ==============================
 File Name: exact.py
 Syntax: python exact.py <input_filename>
 Example: python exact.py data/facebook_directed.txt
 
 Algorithm:2 Hillclimbing Algorithm
 =============================
 There are four variants of the algorithm. The variants are based on the initialization of partial solution.
 
 1.Degree based initialization
 File Name: hillclimbing_init1.py
 Syntax: python hillclimbing_init1.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles> <Threshold_value>
 Example: python hillclimbing_init1.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10 5

 2.All nodes with one role initialization
  File Name: hillclimbing_init2.py
 Syntax: python hillclimbing_init2.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles> <Threshold_value>
 Example: python hillclimbing_init2.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10 5
 
 3.Randome role assignment initialization
 File Name: hillclimbing_init3.py
 Syntax: python hillclimbing_init3.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles> <Threshold_value>
 Example: python hillclimbing_init3.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10 5
 
 4.K-Means based initialization
 File Name: hillclimbing_init4.py
 Syntax: python hillclimbing_init4.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles> <Threshold_value>
 Example: python hillclimbing_init4.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10 5
 
  Algorithm:3 K-Means Algorithm
 =============================
 File Name: kmeans.py
 Syntax: python kmeans.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles>
 Example: python kmeans.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10
 
 
 NOTE: BEFORE EXECUTING ANY ALGORITHMS, PLEASE CREATE TWO FOLDERS NAMED logs and output IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY WHERE THE LOGS AND RESULTS WILL BE STORED
 
 There is also an additional file which converts the undirected graph to directed graph so that it can be used in the algorithm.
 There are also some scripts that were used to calculate the distance metrics such as kendal-tau and munkres etc.
