 There are three algorithms that are implemented for role mining.
 Algorithm:1 Exact Computation
 ==============================
 File Name: exact.py
 Syntax: python exact.py <input_filename>
 Example: python exact.py data/facebook_directed.txt
 
 Algorithm:2 Hillclimbing Algorithm
 =============================
 File Name: hillclimbing.py
 Syntax: python hillclimbing.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles>
 Example: python hillclimbing.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10
 
 There is also a new algorithm with speedup.
  File Name: hillclimbing_thresholdbased.py
 Syntax: python hillclimbing_thresholdbased.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles>
 Example: python hillclimbing_thresholdbased.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10
 
  Algorithm:3 K-Means Algorithm
 =============================
 File Name: kmeans.py
 Syntax: python kmeans.py <input_filename> <No_of_roles>
 Example: python kmeans.py data/facebook_directed.txt 10
 
 
 NOTE: BEFORE EXECUTING ANY ALGORITHMS, PLEASE CREATE TWO FOLDERS NAMED logs and output IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY WHERE THE LOGS AND RESULTS WILL BE STORED
 
 There is also an additional file which converts the undirected graph to directed graph so that it can be used in the algorithm.
